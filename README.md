# genetic_figures
Approximate images with geometric figures.

Basically wanted to do what [primitive](https://github.com/user/repo/blob/branch/other_file.md) (greatly) does, but with a genetic algorithm for no other reason than to use one.

Uses cairo because when I started this project I couldn't find a rust native library that met the requirements I needed.

Bezier curves are still a bit off
